The white circle with the triangle is the symbol for Alcoholics Anonymous and shows that on the journey, help may be needed to overcome.","artwork_title":"Mustard Seed Project","affiliated_or_commissioning":null,"latitude":"41.91096499","zip":"60614","@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k":"37","longitude":"-87.64132499","community_areas":"8","mural_registration_id":"19403","ward":"2","@computed_region_8hcu_yrd4":"2","media":"Paint","@computed_region_bdys_3d7i":"309","location_description":"West facing exterior wall of The Mustard Seed Chicago","year_installed":"2022","street_address":"507 West North Ave","year_restored":null,"@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw":"14926","@computed_region_rpca_8um6":"54"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.64132499,41.91096499]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"artist_credit":"Anthony Lewellen","description_of_artwork":"Lake View by Anthony Lewellen is an iconic 4,000 square-foot mural that celebrates Lakeview at an intersection that has historically served as the geographical center of the neighborhood.

It will become an opportunity to connect with others, to laugh, have fun, and make lasting memories.  Inspired from one of my fondest childhood memories, I will create and paint on each wall a numbered correlation key of animals, plants, and identifiable objects that kids can search for and identify as a fun, engaging, and educational activity to explore and learn. It will be an invitation for everyone to explore, discover, and experience a magical wonderland of forests, nature, wildlife, flora, and fauna. Vibrating with a rich diversity of life, and bursting with new surprises and details to discover at every turn, it will be an exciting place for children to visit and spend time traveling through. With a warm and welcoming gold glow, visitors will feel safe, secure, and comforted by the beauty and inclusivity of Mother Nature’s unconditional embrace.  The metallic gold paint will sparkle and shine adding a deeper level of magic and majesty, evoking a quiet sense of serenity  and connection to the Divine.

COMIGO is Diana Berek, Chiara Padgett, and Juan-Carlos Perez, three Rogers Park artists who have had extensive experience in the visual arts as well as in mural and public arts. They first met when they worked on last year’s Mile of Murals project.    About their response to the theme and their design for the wall, the collective says, “The core of our understanding of Patriotism in Everyday Life resides in this culturally negotiated understanding of “freedom”, i.e. in the perceptions, contradictions, questions, problems and issues that for more than 200 years continue to be challenged and re-defined. It is embedded in a persistent struggle to define and achieve freedom. It is distinctly opposed to casting American values in bellicose chauvinism, or a belief in national superiority. The American narrative is one of a deep striving toward personal success and individual freedom within a social, economic and political fabric of shared liberty and rights. The movement towards these ideals has been rocky, sometimes heroic and enlightened, sometimes ugly and violent, but the vision continues to inspire.”","artwork_title":"Patriotism in Everyday Life","affiliated_or_commissioning":null,"latitude":"42.0086457","zip":"60626","@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k":"10","longitude":"-87.66561428","community_areas":"1","mural_registration_id":"19431","ward":"49","@computed_region_8hcu_yrd4":"49","media":"Paint","@computed_region_bdys_3d7i":"66","location_description":"CTA embankment wall","year_installed":"2011","street_address":"W Lunt Ave & N Glenwood Ave","year_restored":null,"@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw":"21853","@computed_region_rpca_8um6":"9"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.66561428,42.0086457]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"artist_credit":"Ruben Aguirre","description_of_artwork":"The visceral experience of descending into the pedestrian tunnel at Lake Shore Drive and emerging at the waterfront is captured in this mural, but instead of replicating a lakefront scene, Aguirre translates its impression into abstract design elements.","artwork_title":"Untitled","affiliated_or_commissioning":"DCASE","latitude":"41.9039488","zip":"60610","@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k":"37","longitude":"-87.62501932","community_areas":"37","mural_registration_id":"19140","ward":"43","@computed_region_8hcu_yrd4":"2","media":null,"@computed_region_bdys_3d7i":"105","location_description":"Division Street at Lakeshore Path","year_installed":"2017","street_address":"Division Street at Lakeshore Path","year_restored":null,"@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw":"21182","@computed_region_rpca_8um6":"54"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.62501932,41.9039488]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"artist_credit":"Reco The Great and Barrett Keithley","description_of_artwork":"King's Ransom is about the multiplicity of an individual's personality.

The mural displays U.S. Census Bureau  statistics demonstrating disparity between the community of West Garfield Park and more  affluent Chicago-area communities. The data is intended to enhance awareness and  inform the public about issues impacting disinvested communities such as W. Garfield  Park, while underscoring the urgency of these issues. Since information is power, the  project democratizes data so everyone can speak about them in order to find solutions.  The statistics, which will be updated with new Census information as available and after  election cycles, include: life expectancy, median household income, high school  graduation rates, households in poverty, and median home value. The mural states that  these conditions result in lower opportunity for children to thrive compared to other  communities, and includes a space for local residents to place their signatures as a gesture  of endorsement.    The mural is located on one wall of a building that is privately owned and operated as  Nexx Phaze Barber/Beauty/Studio.    The impetus for the mural was the great disparity in life expectancy between W. Garfield  Park and nearby, more affluent communities. Through a companion feature-length  documentary film, \"We Witness,\" Khosro Beik interviewed local residents, business  owners and leaders to shed light on the statistics. The film screened multiple times on  WTTW channel 11, and is currently streaming for three years on WTTW's website. The  City Bricks Project is a collaborative endeavor that plans additional murals, films, public  engagement opportunities, and partnerships in Chicago and elsewhere.  www.CityBricksProject.com    The mural and film have helped to galvanize attention to the issues present in the  community and resources needed to solve them, such as the Sankofa Wellness Village, a  project of the Garfield Park Rite to Wellness Collaborative, which was awarded the 2nd  Annual Chicago Prize from the Pritzker Traubert Foundation in January 2023. We expect that the mural will continue to inspire engagement with and solutions for social justice issues in W. Garfield Park and other communities.","artwork_title":"City Bricks Project: West Garfield Park","affiliated_or_commissioning":null,"latitude":"41.88051378","zip":"60624","@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k":"27","longitude":"-87.73436187","community_areas":"26","mural_registration_id":"19432","ward":"28","@computed_region_8hcu_yrd4":"28","media":"Paint","@computed_region_bdys_3d7i":"717","location_description":"4333 W.

The Audubon Mural Project began in 2014 as a public art initiative of the National Audubon Society, in partnership with the Harlem-based Gitler &_____ Gallery of upper Manhattan, New York. The goal of the project is to paint murals honoring North American bird species that Audubon’s research has determined are threatened by climate change in this century, in order to bring awareness to this environmental crisis.     A report published in 2014 found that 314 North American bird species will be severely threatened by future climate change. By 2080, these species are projected to lose at least half of their current climatic ranges as conditions (especially temperature and precipitation) become unsuitable for their continued survival.    For this project, the Mile of Murals team worked closely with the Audubon Great Lakes Regional Office to identify birds within the Chicago area region that are threatened, across six habitat categories. The birds featured in these murals include the Tree Swallow, Baltimore Oriole, Peregrine Falcon, Bald Eagle, Hooded Merganser, Mallard, and Wood Duck, Black Crowned Night Heron, Black Cormorant, Yellow Bellied Sapsucker, Hairy Woodpecker, Red-breasted Nuthatch, and White-breasted Nuthatch.","artwork_title":"Audubon Mural Project","affiliated_or_commissioning":null,"latitude":"42.00846376","zip":"60626","@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k":"10","longitude":"-87.665608","community_areas":"1","mural_registration_id":"19425","ward":"49","@computed_region_8hcu_yrd4":"49","media":"Paint","@computed_region_bdys_3d7i":"66","location_description":"CTA viaduct walls","year_installed":"2016","street_address":"W Greenleaf Ave & N Glenwood Ave","year_restored":null,"@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw":"21853","@computed_region_rpca_8um6":"9"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.665608,42.00846376]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"artist_credit":"William Weyna","description_of_artwork":"Mural is of brush and spray paint.

Upon first sight it immediately made me think of the many designs links that make up my grandmaï¿½s doilies. I allowed the connection to guide the process of the mural's details. The dripping effect is a direct reflection of the water scenes and rather than make it a focal point, I wanted to create a subtle resemblance to the water while keeping it connected to my graffiti roots.
