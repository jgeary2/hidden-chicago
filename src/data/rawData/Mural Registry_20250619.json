My idea was to make a Forest Rushmore acknowledging the contribution of 20 women whoâ€™ve worked to shape the cultural landscape of the city, past and present.â€\u009d The mural, executed by Artist Jeff Zimmerman, consists of trees as totems decorated by the womenâ€™s faces on the bottom. Up above are the park-like treetops, birds, a yellow-and-blue sun, and a ribbon that floats throughout the mural. \n\nThe cross-cultural, multi-generational list of women include (left to right) actress and cofounder of Dearborn Homes Youth Drama Workshop Cheryl Lynn Bruce; founder of Chicago Childrenâ€™s Theatre Jacqueline Russell; former Chicago First lady and founder of After School Matters Maggie Daley; founder of the DuSable Museum of African American History Margaret Burroughs; founder of Little Black Pearl Monica Haslip; television host and producer Oprah Winfrey; poet Gwendolyn Brooks; former Chicago cultural affairs commissioner Lois Weisberg; actress/writer, and cofounder of Collaboraction theater, Sandra Delgado; journalist and writer Achy Obejas; founder of eta Creative Arts Foundation Abena Joan Brown; Poetry magazine founder Harriet Monroe; founder of Black Ensemble Theater Jackie Taylor; founder and Artistic director of Chicago Shakespeare Theater Barbara Gaines; former director of the Renaissance Society Suzanne Ghez; dancer and president of Muntu Dance Theatre of Chicago Joan Gray; dancer, choreographer, and founder of Ruth Page Center for the Arts Ruth Page; writer Sandra Ciseneros; Artist and cofounder of the AfricCobra  collective Barbara Jones-Hogu; Janes Saks, founder of Project & and the Ellen stone Belic Institute for the study of Women and Gender in the Arts and Media.\n\nThe mural is funded by Murals of Acceptance, whose goal is to bring art to all people in a free public setting.",

After experiencing SkyART’s transformative youth programs, Troyli connected deeply with young artists aged 7 to 13, recognizing the profound impact of SkyART’s mission to provide free art programming and art therapy. In collaboration with SkyWAY artists, Troyli crafted a powerful message for Chicago's youth: to forge their own paths and create their own possibilities. What began as simple doodles evolved into a breathtaking masterpiece, portraying a young man of color, donning in Troyli’s iconic afro and Chicago Jordans, climbing a ladder while painting vast clouds into a bright blue sky. This towering figure, a symbol of self-determination and the creation of one's own reality, proudly overlooks the city from the Green Line. The mural was installed by the talented muralists Jasmina Amalya Cazacu and Jesse Navarrete.",

They have a passion for working for and with communities to inspire public spaces with large-scale artworks.

The theme for the wall was a general call for Bicycle Transportation, and artist Bruno Carneiro Mosciaro, aka Bruno Big, an artist based in Rio De Janeiro, won the commission.     In \"Bike-­‐Family\", Bruno Big approached the theme of using Bicycles as a collective joyful experience and integrating people with the environment and among themselves. The idea of depicting a family riding a bicycle is also a way of transforming the model of families owning a car and this being the main source of transportation and demonstrating that the act of riding a bicycle can be fun.      Bruno Big works in a variety of media and is known for his vibrant colors and large forms that capture the subtle poetry of motion, the vivid pulse of life, and the dark mystery of death.",

It will inspire us to dream, to explore, to experience the childlike wonder and awe that connects us all at our core. It will serve as a reminder of the innate love and wisdom that is felt when we interact with nature, and the profound way we are moved by the beauty and diversity of the natural world. With endless opportunities for photos and “Instagrammable” moments with children and adults alike, the artwork will become a backdrop for treasured family moments, memories, and milestones. A place of discovery, learning, connection and teaching moments for parents, children, friends, and families. It will become an opportunity to connect with others, to laugh, have fun, and make lasting memories.  Inspired from one of my fondest childhood memories, I will create and paint on each wall a numbered correlation key of animals, plants, and identifiable objects that kids can search for and identify as a fun, engaging, and educational activity to explore and learn. It will be an invitation for everyone to explore, discover, and experience a magical wonderland of forests, nature, wildlife, flora, and fauna. Vibrating with a rich diversity of life, and bursting with new surprises and details to discover at every turn, it will be an exciting place for children to visit and spend time traveling through. With a warm and welcoming gold glow, visitors will feel safe, secure, and comforted by the beauty and inclusivity of Mother Nature’s unconditional embrace.  The metallic gold paint will sparkle and shine adding a deeper level of magic and majesty, evoking a quiet sense of serenity  and connection to the Divine. Whether passing by on foot, two wheels, or four, it will be a uniquely personal and beautiful journey of remembering. Remembering the source of who we are, individually, and as one. Remembering to dream, to soar, and to be the best that we can be.",

Describing his work as it applies to the theme of individualism/interdependence, Mear says:    \"When I was first introduced to the 'Miles of Murals' project, the first thought that sprung to mind was a series of interlocking images, representing a powerful symbol of humanity connected as it were by a plethora of varying shapes and forms, colors and contrasts.    Yet despite this variance, or perhaps in spite of it, there exudes a uniform strength of pattern, repetition and interconnectedness of and between individuals, each individual being part and parcel of a larger community, albeit humanity. Everyone exists as an equal agent of change unto themselves. Everyone bears witness to humankind's grander narrative of a shared spiritual past, present and future, a genetic chain spanning throughout time immemorial, dividing and duplicating into a spectrum of multitudinous colors and relations, of multitudinous humanities and gods.\"",

COMIGO is Diana Berek, Chiara Padgett, and Juan-Carlos Perez, three Rogers Park artists who have had extensive experience in the visual arts as well as in mural and public arts. They first met when they worked on last year’s Mile of Murals project.    About their response to the theme and their design for the wall, the collective says, “The core of our understanding of Patriotism in Everyday Life resides in this culturally negotiated understanding of “freedom”, i.e. in the perceptions, contradictions, questions, problems and issues that for more than 200 years continue to be challenged and re-defined. It is embedded in a persistent struggle to define and achieve freedom. It is distinctly opposed to casting American values in bellicose chauvinism, or a belief in national superiority. The American narrative is one of a deep striving toward personal success and individual freedom within a social, economic and political fabric of shared liberty and rights. The movement towards these ideals has been rocky, sometimes heroic and enlightened, sometimes ugly and violent, but the vision continues to inspire.”",

His latest work utilizes silhouettes of figures, with references within that signfiy a locality or evoke a nostalgic tone.  Music runs as a theme in his work, and the character here references a jazz singer from a former era.",

A mural can be painted over easily, or will fade in the sun anyway . . .  it basically proves that a single person can claim a space in this big world and make a statement visible. I think that is a very empowering messageï¿½ ï¿½ as quoted in Sandra Steinbrecherï¿½s Wabash Arts Corridor / Big Walls / 2016",

The Union Pacific Railroad viaduct at Ravenswood and Berteau avenues serves as a gateway to this community. It’s the entrance to festivals like the Ravenswood ArtWalk and is prominently located along the Ravenswood Sculpture Garden. At it’s center shines For My Neighbors, With Love, a mural by local artist Ponnopozz (Adrianne Hawthorne).\n\n\"The Ravenswood Arts Corridor is a vibrant, diverse place. So many creatives come together here, whether\nfocused on traditional art forms like painting and sculpture, or brewing signature beers for the community\nto enjoy. I want the shapes and colors in this mural to dance off the wall, to give life to the feelings of joy I\nhave because I’m a part of this community.\n\nArt, especially public art, is a powerful thing. I want viewers of my mural to pause as they drive by, to stop walking and go up to the piece for a closer look. The mural I’ve created for my beloved Ravenswood embodies the wonder, joy, vibrancy, diversity, and strength I see in my fellow small businesses and neighbors.\" - Adrianne Hawthorne",

The enormous amount of intentional memories created in front of my murals are so profound it should continually remind us that art is an extremely important part of our lives. People watch and document the process from start to finish and ultimately feel attached to the project. Art creates an emotional connection within us. It allows us to pay attention and to be connected to it and thus be connected with others. My desire to contribute something positive and worthwhile is so strong one might say art is what makes me feel human. This project was a great experience and example of why public art is so important. I wanted the community to be proud of something positive that belongs to them. To have it be a constant reminder to be bold, to flex the hustle, and to hopefully have the desire to create somethingï¿½big or small.ï¿½\nTHIS IS LAKEVIEW is funded by Special Service Area 27, whose mission is to support a vibrant local economy and high quality of life for the benefit of Lakeview businesses and residents by improving and enhancing public streets and spaces, creating memorable experiences, encouraging spending locally and promoting the neighborhood.

The mural displays U.S. Census Bureau  statistics demonstrating disparity between the community of West Garfield Park and more  affluent Chicago-area communities. The data is intended to enhance awareness and  inform the public about issues impacting disinvested communities such as W. Garfield  Park, while underscoring the urgency of these issues. Since information is power, the  project democratizes data so everyone can speak about them in order to find solutions.  The statistics, which will be updated with new Census information as available and after  election cycles, include: life expectancy, median household income, high school  graduation rates, households in poverty, and median home value. The mural states that  these conditions result in lower opportunity for children to thrive compared to other  communities, and includes a space for local residents to place their signatures as a gesture  of endorsement.    The mural is located on one wall of a building that is privately owned and operated as  Nexx Phaze Barber/Beauty/Studio.    The impetus for the mural was the great disparity in life expectancy between W. Garfield  Park and nearby, more affluent communities. Through a companion feature-length  documentary film, \"We Witness,\" Khosro Beik interviewed local residents, business  owners and leaders to shed light on the statistics. The film screened multiple times on  WTTW channel 11, and is currently streaming for three years on WTTW's website. The  City Bricks Project is a collaborative endeavor that plans additional murals, films, public  engagement opportunities, and partnerships in Chicago and elsewhere.  www.CityBricksProject.com    The mural and film have helped to galvanize attention to the issues present in the  community and resources needed to solve them, such as the Sankofa Wellness Village, a  project of the Garfield Park Rite to Wellness Collaborative, which was awarded the 2nd  Annual Chicago Prize from the Pritzker Traubert Foundation in January 2023. We expect that the mural will continue to inspire engagement with and solutions for social justice issues in W. Garfield Park and other communities.",

The Audubon Mural Project began in 2014 as a public art initiative of the National Audubon Society, in partnership with the Harlem-based Gitler &_____ Gallery of upper Manhattan, New York. The goal of the project is to paint murals honoring North American bird species that Audubon’s research has determined are threatened by climate change in this century, in order to bring awareness to this environmental crisis.     A report published in 2014 found that 314 North American bird species will be severely threatened by future climate change. By 2080, these species are projected to lose at least half of their current climatic ranges as conditions (especially temperature and precipitation) become unsuitable for their continued survival.    For this project, the Mile of Murals team worked closely with the Audubon Great Lakes Regional Office to identify birds within the Chicago area region that are threatened, across six habitat categories. The birds featured in these murals include the Tree Swallow, Baltimore Oriole, Peregrine Falcon, Bald Eagle, Hooded Merganser, Mallard, and Wood Duck, Black Crowned Night Heron, Black Cormorant, Yellow Bellied Sapsucker, Hairy Woodpecker, Red-breasted Nuthatch, and White-breasted Nuthatch.",

The over-saturated aquamarine leaves and large red fruit are meant to evoke feelings of fertile soil. The very name of the mural, “Big Fruit”, is a play on the names given to other towns or cities. As if to say, “Howard Street, Land of the Big Fruit”, where people can settle, grow and happily sustain. Fischer also thought that the bold, lively color scheme would cut through the drearier winter days as commuters waited on the 2nd busiest train platform in the city.",

The design inspiration comes from my family heirlooms-\"carpetas tejidas\" the delicate and intricate original crocheted designs of my grandmother and great grandmother. After watching some of Luzia, I reflected on the massive red papel picado that was used to incubate the twirling dancer ascending in one of the scenes as flower petals fell. Upon first sight it immediately made me think of the many designs links that make up my grandmaï¿½s doilies. I allowed the connection to guide the process of the mural's details. The dripping effect is a direct reflection of the water scenes and rather than make it a focal point, I wanted to create a subtle resemblance to the water while keeping it connected to my graffiti roots. Drips are common and often the most enjoyable parts of ink tags and natural spray paint abstracts when doing stylized letters. It is important for me to stay true to my Mexican & Graffiti culture for the two has been an integral part of my life and visual art form. I want to honor and elevate them in ways that donï¿½t appropriate or erase the values or struggles that have endured through their evolution and survival.ï¿½ The Magia de Luzia was curated and organized by Columbia College Chicago as part of the Wabash Arts Corridor Street Level Public Art Exhibition, and sponsored by Cirque du Soleil in honor of the production LUZIA in Chicago, Illinois.",

One such conversation focused on a photograph I took in Haiti soon after the earthquake; it was an image of Haitian students celebrating their recent graduation from a healthcare training program. I wanted to present the image as respectful, and not voyeuristic.    My friend said, “call it Resilience.” It was the perfect word. It was exactly what the photograph represented. Resilience has been one of my favorite words ever since.",

In order to capture the essence of this phrase, I portrayed a lush bouquet of Chrysanthemums, Roses, Echinacea, and prairie grasses. Each of these blooms can be found in the city and serves a purpose in the bouquet apart from making a beautiful arrangement. Chrysanthemums are Chicago's official flower, so they are featured most prominently in the mural. Roses are universally recognizable and loved, but they were also Anne Hewlett Fuller's favorite, and the bloom that the famous Chicagoan architect and designer Buckminster Fuller gave her in courtship. Echinacea and prairie grasses are both found growing wild in Chicago, a nod to the abundance of beautiful wild foliage in Illinois. The symbolic blooms coupled with the title of the piece honor the city's close and nuanced relationship with nature.\"\n\nURBS IN HORTO is part of the Lakeview Public Art Program, an initiative\nof Special Service Area 27 and its 501(c)(3) non-profit partner organization, Friends of Lakeview which showases original works of art by innovative artists throughout the West Lakeview neighborhood.\nLearn more at www.lakeviewchamber.com/art .",
